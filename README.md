C# .NET Battleship game simulation with Angular frontend.

## Project Assumptions

In this project, it is assumed that game is single player (Player vs Computer). New Game button generates ships randomly on grids needed in game algorithm. If player makes a move, computer responds to it by making its own move - random generated and cannot be repeated. Every move (shot) is marked on player's and computer's grid. Grids are not visible to opposite players.
