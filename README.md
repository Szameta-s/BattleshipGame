## Project Assumptions
In this project, it is assumed that game is single player (Player vs Computer). New Game button generates ships and grids needed in game algorithm. If player makes a move, computer responds to it by making its own move.
Every move (shot) is marked on player's and computer's grid. Grids are not visible to opposite players.
